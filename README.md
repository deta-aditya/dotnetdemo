Demo and example codes in .NET

Always wanted to learn more about .NET, but Visual Studio Code doesn't have a good support for it. Even Visual Studio is pretty hard to use. 
Thanks to Rider - which I happened to find out how to get a free and legal license, I can finally explore .NET comfortably. It's quite fun, especially F#.
